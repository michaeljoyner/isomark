            <p>Assessments can be conducted to assess the compliance level of existing Safety, Health and Environment System, be it an ISO System or any other. All Safety, Health and Environment aspects will be assessed according to the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 or company legal register. A detailed report will be supplied to Senior Management detailing improvement and corrective recommendations.</p>
            <h3 class="service-section-title">Isomark Consulting Option</h3>

This option is determined on client needs and risk profile.</p>
